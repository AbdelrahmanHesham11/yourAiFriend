myAifriend

myAifriend is a simple web app built to be a supportive companion when you need someone to talk to. You can call into the app, speak freely about what’s on your mind, and it will listen, respond, and generate remedies or motivational quotes tailored to what you share. It’s not about therapy or professional advice—it’s just meant to be a voice on the other side when you want to vent, clear your thoughts, or have a reminder that you’re not alone.

The app uses AI to generate responses in real time and provide a kind of “shoulder to lean on” when you’re stressed. You talk, it listens, and it gives you something back that can help you move forward.
